# Influence Of Roles
This repository contains supplementary data for our paper titled "Influence of Roles in Decision-Making during OSS Development â€” A Study of Python" which has been accepted at the The International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 21) conference.

Supplementary data includes three items.
1) A screenshot of the tool we developed which was used to infer and capture the rationale behind PEP decisions. This tool allowed us to manually go through and analyse the messages related to each of the 248 accepted or rejected PEPs.

2) Email contributions and SNA metrics. This spreadsheet contains a number of sheets which highlight different information related to how memebers from different Python roles contribute in Decision-making discussions in 415 PEPs when the project leader (Python BDFL) makes the PEP decisions against the 51 PEPs when the deicisons are made by others in the Python community (as BDFL Delegates). This includes the social roles they perform in DM discussions, and the Social network Analysis metrics. This spreadsheet contains the follwing sheets:
 - Overall Contributions
 - Contributions by PEP type
 - SNA Metrics

5) Rationale behind PEP decisions. This spreadsheet contains the description of each rationale behind PEP decisions and sample sentences that depict the rationale behind their decisions for the 248 accepted and rejected PEPs. Description of each rationale and their proportions grouped by PEP types are also included. This spreadsheet contains the follwing sheets:
 - Rationale
 - Rationale Sentences
 - Rationale by DM Scheme
 - Rationale by PEP type
 - Ratioanel with PEp numbers

The publication is related to our reserach project investigating Decision-making processes in Open source software development communities. 

The paper is also available here (Read Only). A preprint version of this paper is available on ResearchGate [DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.28548.27523] and arXiv. 

These projects are research projects that deal with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
