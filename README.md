# influenceOfRoles
This repository contains supplementary data for our paper titled "Influence of Roles in Decision-Making during OSS Development â€” A Study of Python" which has been accepted at the The International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 21) conference.

Supplementary data includes three items.
1) A screenshot of the tool we developed which was used to infer and capture the rationale behind PEP decisions. This tool allowed us to manually go through and analyse the messages related to each of the 248 accepted or rejected PEPs.

2) Email contributions. This spreadsheet contains a number of sheets which highlight different information related to how memebers from different Python roles contribute in Decision-making discussions in 415 PEPs when the project leader (Python BDFL) makes the PEP decisions against the 51 PEPs when the deicisons are made by others in the Python community (as BDFL Delegates). This includes the social roles they perform in DM discussions, the Social network Analysis metrics,
